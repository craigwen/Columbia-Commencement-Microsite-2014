"
      </p>
        
          <p><strong>Heroic attack was carried out in two stages :</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1 . The first car bomb in car</strong></p>
          <p>On the morning of Wednesday the 10th of Qa `dah 1433 H coincides with the 26 September 2012 M 07.00 am , the warrior martyr bombers , Abu Muhannad ash- Syami managed to bring the car loaded with bombs in the direction parallel to the fence Army Headquarters building National from the south .</p>
          <p>When he had reached the point closest to the center of the right wall of fence building , he blew himself up causing great destruction at the Headquarters building in that direction . The explosion of tremendous strength that reached the inside of the building , killing many soldiers , wounding many other soldiers and caused panic and fear outstanding against soldiers who escaped from the explosion .</p>
          <p><strong>2 . The second car bomb and a small squad of invaders into the building</strong></p>
          <p>A second car bomb that also carry a full strength squad invaders three attackers Nushrah jabhah Mujahid martyred ; Abu Hafs Ash- Syami , Abu Khalid ash- Syami and Abu Mus'ab ash- Syami . The car slid into the main gate of the Syrian Armed Forces Headquarters . Chaotic atmosphere in the complex of buildings used by the third person to picket the soldiers ordered the gate to open the gate .</p>
          <p>The soldiers thought the three men were high ranking officers in charge of the security headquarters . They believe that after seeing three men wearing army uniforms similar to the uniform they wear . The picket soldiers immediately opened the gate , the car and the three fighters into the courtyard .</p>
          <p>All three fighters that every soldier then shot dead in front of them and they start to burst into the Army Headquarters building . They mastered the first floor of the building , with the grace and help of God alone , shot and killed every soldier and officer that they meet and then burn the inside of the first floor of the building . They then detonated a car full of bombs that they parked at the main gate by remote control from a distance . As a result, a loud explosion and flames devoured the front of the building . Fire at the front of the building continued until 16:00 pm , even later .</p>
          <p>Third mujahid was then up to the second floor to the second floor master . They shot and killed every soldier and officer that they find , and then they burned the second floor room of the building.</p>
          <p>After that they go up to the third floor and survive on the top floor of the building , after they shot and killed all the soldiers in the floor and the soldiers stationed in the courtyard . They begin to resist the onslaught of fierce Bashar Asad regime forces who flocked as reinforcements for the troops at the headquarters .</p>
          <p>All three fighters that survive in the top floor of the building by using a DShK , RPG rockets , machine guns and assault rifles . The battle lasted three hours , between an army with weapons and complete amunis against three people Mujahid ! Yes , only four fighters jabhah Nushrah alone . But really much difference between the people who fight in the way of Evil and the people who fight for Allah ta'ala . The fighting only stopped when each mujahid passed away to the mercy of Allah , may Allah accept them in the ranks of the martyrs ' .</p>
          <p><strong>Communication with third mujahid mujahideen commander in the Headquarters building</strong></p>
          <p>This new, very impressive in this video is the communication via HP between the three fighters who have fought and survived in the headquarters building jabhah Nushrah mujahideen commander who led the heroic operation .</p>
          <p>Asked third Mujahedeen fighters in the headquarters building to tell each of their development in the building . Abu Khalid ash- Syami began to recount the events since the three of them reached the gate of the building until they managed to reach the third floor of the building .</p>
          <p>&quot; They are very cowardly and timid . So we ordered them to open the gate , the soldiers on guard immediately opened the door for us . Cars could we have brought into the courtyard with ease , praise be to God alone , &quot; said Abu Khalid ash- Syami via HP .</p>
          <p>When cars are parked in the courtyard of their blasts by remote control from the headquarters building and they managed to burn - runganan rooms and offices in the first floor and two headquarters buildings , three fighters were still in contact and notify any developments to the commander of the Mujahideen .</p>
          <p>Abu Hafs Ash- Syami and Abu Khalid ash- Syami reported from inside the building that the number of military officers and soldiers who had been shot dead on the floor of their one , two and three headquarters buildings totaling more than one hundred people . Each floor of the building consists of about 26 rooms and offices . Third mujahid it burn all papers and files and the contents of each room and offices . Fire devoured the entire first floor , two and three headquarters buildings .</p>
          <p>&quot; There are a lot of maps , files , documents and programs . Al - hamdulillah , we 've burned everything until sold out . &quot; Report Abu Hafs Ash- Syami via HP .</p>
          <p>When the rooms and offices on the fourth floor began to burn them , and exchanged fire with the Syrian regime forces intensified, Abu Mus'ab ash- Syami began to report to the commander jabhah Nushrah . All three fighters that feel relief , calmness and peace of God to face the incessant rain of bullets Syrian regime forces .</p>
          <p>&quot;O sheikh , I swear by Allah , we feel the calmness and peace . No worries whatsoever . Alhamdulillh Rabbil the worlds . God affirms us , O sheikh . &quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; Allahu akbar . Walhamdu lillah . Allahu akbar . We pray that you return the place is a paradise with the prophets , siddiqin , martyrs ' and the Righteous . &quot;Replied commander via HP .</p>
          <p>&quot; What a battle atmosphere ,&quot; asked the commander again .</p>
          <p>&quot; Al - hamdulillah , every time they tried to lunge forward , we kill them , &quot; said Abu Mus'ab ash- Syami .</p>
          <p>Before the martyrdom , the third mujahid mujahideen commander was asked by jabhah Nushrah . &quot;Later regime media vanity , Nushairiyah regime will accuse you kill innocent civilians ? &quot;</p>
          <p>&quot; By Allah , O sheikh , no one besides us kill soldiers . Al - hamdulillah we just gunning down the officers and soldiers . Al - hamdulillah , we also see women employees in the other building ( the Headquarters complex ) , but we did not shoot them at all . We did not kill one of the civil servants , al - hamdulillah . &quot; Replied Abu Hafs Ash- Syami .</p>
          <p>Gunfire sounded more incentive . Third mujahid last will then give them to the Muslims . Back sounding heavy fire . After the third communication mujahid Headquarters building on the fourth floor with mujahideen commander disconnected .</p>
          <p><strong>results of the battle</strong></p>
          <p>Third Resistance jabhah Nushrah on the fourth floor of the Headquarters building eventually reaching a martyr , God willing . But the Syrian regime will have to deploy thousands of troops and weaponry involved in fierce fighting with light, medium and heavy to reclaim the building .</p>
          <p>Firefight has lasted more than three hours . But thousands of troops Syrian regime is so timid and coward to the extent that they do not dare stormed into the building . They plied their own headquarters with RPG rockets and heavy machine guns , so that the more severe the damage to the building . The fire burned the greater the rooms and offices in the building .</p>
          <p>Sounds reporter Shiite TV station Al - Manar thousands of soldiers accompanying the Syrian regime was shaking with fear evident incredible . &quot; We are currently located on the third floor of the building, everything is on fire . Troops have menaklukklan floors one and two , and now is trying to snatch the fourth floor . &quot; Said the reporter .</p>
